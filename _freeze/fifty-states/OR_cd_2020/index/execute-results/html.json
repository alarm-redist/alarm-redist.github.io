Rev. Stat. § 188.010:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>be contiguous</li>\n<li>be of equal population</li>\n<li>utilize existing geographic or political boundaries</li>\n<li>not divide communities of common interest</li>\n<li>be connected by transportation links</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additionally, districts may not favor any political party or\nincumbent, and may not dilute the voting strength of any language or\nethnic minority group.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<style>\nd-article {\n    overflow: visible !important;\n}\n</style>\n",
