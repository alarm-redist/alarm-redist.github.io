See full documentation and code for the complete implementation details.\n\n\n\n\n<p>In Minnesota, districts must: 1. be convenient and contiguous (<a href=\"https://www.revisor.mn.gov/constitution/#section_4_3\">Minn. Const.\nart. IV, § 3</a>) 2. be substantially equal in population (<a href=\"https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/2021/cite/2.91\">Minn. Stat.\n2.91</a>) 3. not divide political subdivisions more than necessary to\nmeet constitutional requirements (<a href=\"https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/2021/cite/2.91\">Minn. Stat.\n2.91</a>)</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the following principles guide redistricting in\nMinnesota which stipulate that districts must: 4. have populations as\nnearly as equal as practical 5. preserve communities of interest 6. not\nabridge voting rights of minority groups 7. not unduly protect nor\ndefeat incumbents (<a href=\"https://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/CIOMediaLibrary/2011Redistricting/A110152Order9-12-11.pdf\">Order\nof the Special Redistricting Panel, Hippert vs. Ritchie,\nNo. A11-152</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<style>\nd-article {\n    overflow: visible !important;\n}\n</style>\n",
