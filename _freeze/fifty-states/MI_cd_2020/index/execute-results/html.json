See full documentation and code for the complete implementation details.\n\n\n\n\n<p>In Michigan, districts must:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>be contiguous (Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6(13)(b)). Island areas are\nconsidered to be contiguous by land to the county of which they are a\npart.</li>\n<li>have equal populations (Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6(13)(a))</li>\n<li>be geographically compact (Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6(13)(g))</li>\n<li>reflect consideration of county, city, and township boundaries\n(Mich. Const. art. IV, § 6(13)(f))</li>\n<li>not provide a disproportionate advantage to any political party,\ndetermined using accepted measures of partisan fairness (Mich. Const.\nart. IV, § 6(13)(d))</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Based on the current plan, two districts should be majority-minority\nin order to comply with the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<style>\nd-article {\n    overflow: visible !important;\n}\n</style>\n",
