The package allows users to test for illegal partisan and racial gerrymandering, a timely and important question in the wake of the 2020 Census and the redistricting cycle that followed. It has had a substantial policy impact seeing use in legal challenges against and, unusually, has also been cited by six Supreme Court justices in oral arguments. In short, it is an ideal recipient of the Society for Political Methodolgy's 2022 Statistical Software Award.\n\n\nWe are grateful for the honor! Thank you to the award committee for considering our software.\n\n`redist` is an open source R package for sampling redistricting plans, [available here](https://alarm-redist.org/redist/):\n\n> This R package enables researchers to sample redistricting plans from a pre-specified target distribution using Sequential Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The package supports various constraints in the redistricting process, such as geographic compactness and population parity requirements. Tools for analysis, including computation of various summary statistics and plotting functionality, are also included.\n\n`redist` is a key tool for much of our work, which has enabled work on [identifying bias in Census 2020](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abk3283), [creating alternative plans for all 50 states](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01808-2), [reducing malapportionment in Japan](https://alarm-redist.org/posts/2022-09-30-nikkei/), [assessing partisan bias in 2022's congressional districts](https://alarm-redist.org/posts/2022-08-14-gerrymandering-mostly-cancels-nationally/), and more.\n\n\n",
