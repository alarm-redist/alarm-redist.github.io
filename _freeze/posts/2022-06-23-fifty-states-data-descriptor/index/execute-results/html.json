The abstract is listed below.\n\n> This article introduces the 50stateSimulations, a collection of simulated congressional districting plans and underlying code developed by the Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology (ALARM) Project. The 50stateSimulations allow for the evaluation of enacted and other congressional redistricting plans in the United States. While the use of redistricting simulation algorithms has become standard in academic research and court cases, any simulation analysis requires non-trivial efforts to combine multiple data sets, identify state-specific redistricting criteria, implement complex simulation algorithms, and summarize and visualize simulation outputs. We have developed a complete workflow that facilitates this entire process of simulation-based redistricting analysis for the congressional districts of all 50 states. The resulting 50stateSimulations include ensembles of simulated 2020 congressional redistricting plans and necessary replication data. We also provide the underlying code, which serves as a template for customized analyses. All data and code are free and publicly available. This article details the design, creation, and validation of the data.\n\nTo help make things more usable for those who don't simulate redistricting plans in their free time, we are also excited to (soft) launch a new R package, [`alarmdata`](https://github.com/alarm-redist/alarmdata).\nThis package provides a simplified interface to download the underlying geographic data, generated plans, all sorts of summary statistics, and state-by-state documentation.\n\nThe package can be installed with:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nremotes::install_github('alarm-redist/alarmdata')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThank you to the Harvard Data Science Initiative and Microsoft for computational support.\n",
