The Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology (ALARM) Project is a research group directed by Co-PIs [Kosuke Imai](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/), [Christopher T. Kenny](https://christophertkenny.com/), [Cory McCartan](https://corymccartan.com/), and [Tyler Simko](https://tylersimko.com/).

ALARM conducts research on political geography and spatial inequality. We actively work in areas like legislative redistricting, segregation, Census data, and school rezoning. We also develop open-source software to enable this research, like the R package [redist](https://alarm-redist.org/redist/).

<h2><code>redist</code>: Simulation Methods for Legislative Redistricting</h2>
</a>
<p>
Enables researchers to sample redistricting plans from a pre-specified target
distribution using state-of-the-art algorithms. Implements a wide variety
constraints in the redistricting process, such as geographic compactness and
population parity requirements. Tools for analysis such as computation of
various summary statistics and plotting functionality are also included.
