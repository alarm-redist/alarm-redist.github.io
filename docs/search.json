It conducts research into redistricting sampling algorithms, best practices and workflows for redistricting analysis, and tools to visualize, explore, and understand redistricting plans. ALARM Project researchers develop redist, an open-source R package for redistricting simulation and analysis which implements state-of-the-art MCMC and SMC redistricting sampling algorithms. The package allows for the implementation of various constraints in the redistricting process such as geographic compactness and population parity requirements, and includes tools to compute various summary statistics and create useful plots.\nPeople\nBen Fifield, American Civil Liberties Union\nGeorge Garcia III\nKosuke Imai, Departments of Government and Statistics, Harvard University\nChristopher Kenny, Department of Government, Harvard University\nShiro Kuriwaki, Department of Political Science, Stanford University\nSho Miyazaki, Keio University\nCory McCartan, Department of Statistics, Harvard University\nEvan Rosenman, Harvard Data Science Initiative\nTyler Simko, Department of Government, Harvard University\nSam Thau, Harvard College\nKevin Wang, Harvard College\nMelissa Wu\nKento Yamada, Harvard College\nRei Yatsuhashi, Harvard College\nAnna Yorozuya, University of Tokyo\nPublications\nAutomated Redistricting Simulation Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics (2020) Vol. 29, No. 4, pp. 715-728.\nThe Essential Role of Empirical Validation in Legislative Redistricting Simulation Statistics and Public Policy (2020) Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 52-68.\nSequential Monte Carlo for Sampling Balanced and Compact Redistricting Plans\nThe use of differential privacy for census data and its impact on redistricting: The case of the 2020 U.S. Census Science Advances (2021) Vol. 7, No. 41.\nRelated R Packages\nblockpop: Estimate Census Block Populations for 2020.
