It conducts research into redistricting sampling algorithms, best practices and workflows for redistricting analysis, and tools to visualize, explore, and understand redistricting plans. ALARM Project researchers develop redist, an open-source R package for redistricting simulation and analysis which implements state-of-the-art MCMC and SMC redistricting sampling algorithms. The package allows for the implementation of various constraints in the redistricting process such as geographic compactness and population parity requirements, and includes tools to compute various summary statistics and create useful plots.\nPeople\nTahmid Ahmed, Harvard College\nBen Fifield, American Civil Liberties Union\nAvi Gulati, Harvard College\nKosuke Imai, Departments of Government and Statistics, Harvard University\nChristopher Kenny, Department of Government, Harvard University\nShiro Kuriwaki, Department of Government, Harvard University\nCory McCartan, Department of Statistics, Harvard University\nEvan Rosenman, Harvard Data Science Initiative\nTyler Simko, Department of Government, Harvard University\nKevin Wang, Harvard College\nRei Yatsuhashi\nPublications\nAutomated Redistricting Simulation Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics (2020) Vol. 29, No. 4, pp. 715-728.\nThe Essential Role of Empirical Validation in Legislative Redistricting Simulation Statistics and Public Policy Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 52-68.\nSequential Monte Carlo for Sampling Balanced and Compact Redistricting Plans\nThe Impact of the U.S. Census Disclosure Avoidance System on Redistricting and Voting Rights Analysis\n\n\n\n",
