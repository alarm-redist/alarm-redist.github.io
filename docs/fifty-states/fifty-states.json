these districts may find the documentation for redist and redistmetrics useful.\r\nHow should I interpret the simulation graphs?\r\nThe graphs we provide with each simulation compare the enacted plan with the range of alternative plans in terms of expected number of seats, election results by districts, partisan bias, and some traditional districting criteria.\r\nWe explain how to interpret graphs with examples below.\r\nExpected number of seats\r\nIn each state, we average across several statewide elections from 2016-2020, and represent the range of the expected number of districts won by a party with a histogram.\r\nIn Oregon, for example, Democrats are expected to win about 3.5 out of the 6 congressional districts under simulated plans.\r\nThis is close to proportional representation of their statewide vote of 3.3 Democratic seats.\r\nIn contrast, under the enacted plan, the Democratic party is expected to win as many as 4.2 seats.\r\nLess than 1% of simulated plans would yield the same or higher expected number of Democratic seats as the enacted plan.\r\nThe histogram ranges from 3.5 to 4.5, which tells us that the Democrats would likely not be able to consistently win 5 seats under Oregon’s geography, legal constraints, and recent performance in statewide elections, regardless of the plan.\r\nA takeaway from this histogram is that although the majority party usually wins more seats than proportional representation, the enacted map is a statistical outlier in the degree of that Democratic advantage.\r\n\r\nElection results by districts\r\nIn addition to the statewide, we can also compare the enacted plan with the simulated plans at the district level.\r\nWe first order the districts of the enacted plan by the variable of interest.\r\nFor example, to evaluate district level Democratic vote in Oregon with 6 districts, we sort the districts from the least Democratic (ordered district 1) to the most Democratic district (ordered district 6).\r\nWe repeat this for each of the simulated plans.\r\nOnce the districts are sorted for both the enacted and simulated plans, we use a dot to represent the Democratic vote percent for each ordered district of a simulated plan.\r\nFor the enacted plan, we use a black horizontal line.\r\nThis allows visual comparison between the enacted and simulated plans.\r\nIn the example below, the enacted plan appears to pack Republicans in the most Republican district (1), while making the second most Republican district (2) barely Democratic.\r\nAgain, the number on the x-axis does not correspond to the actual district number under the enacted plan.\r\nInstead, it represents the order of districts sorted by the variable of interest for each plan.\r\nThe variable of interest is then made into the y-axis.\r\n\r\nPartisan bias metrics\r\nWe measure the partisan bias of a plan in two ways: the efficiency gap and the deviation from partisan symmetry.\r\nThe efficiency gap of a plan is the difference in the two party’s wasted votes as a fraction of the statewide turnout.\r\nIt is a measure of packing and cracking.\r\nIf a Democrat won a district with 60% of the vote, then each vote above 50% + 1 of the total votes are wasted because the district could have won by 50% + 1 votes.\r\nSimilarly, if a Democrat loses a district with 45%, then each of those votes are wasted because those votes did not lead to a seat.\r\nThe efficiency gap for Democrats shown in the histogram is the Democratic wasted votes minus the Republican wasted votes.\r\nThus, positive values indicate a pro-Republican bias whereas a negative value indicates a pro-Democratic bias.\r\nIn the Oregon plan, the gap is -0.10, meaning that Democratic votes are wasted at a much smaller rate than Republican votes.\r\n\r\nAnother measure we use is deviation from partisan symmetry in the seats-votes curve.\r\nSuppose a plan leads to 60% Democratic seats when their statewide vote share is 55%.\r\nIf the map satisfies partisan symmetry, the Republican seat share should also be 60% if they win 55% of the votes in another election.\r\nWe represent the deviation from partisan symmetry by computing the excess Republican seat share above 50% when their vote share is 50%.\r\nThis measure is typically called the “partisan bias” of a plan in the academic literature on redistricting.\r\nIn the Oregon example below, the 0.1 deviation from partisan symmetry means that in a 50-50 election, the plan allocates 60% of seats to the Republicans, rather than the symmetric outcome of 50% of seats.\r\nWhile the enacted plan is more favorable towards the Republican party than a plan that exhibits partisan symmetry (a value of 0), it still favors the Democratic plan more than the modal simulated plan (around 0.18 on the histogram).\r\nTraditional Redistricting Criteria\r\nThe histograms for compactness and counties split compare the enacted and expected maps in the same way as partisan metrics.\r\nWe measure geographic compactness with the Polsby-Popper compactness score of each district, and take its average across districts.\r\nPolsby Popper scores range from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating a circle.\r\nThe “counties split” measure is the number of counties which are not wholly contained within a single district.\r\nIn the Oregon example, the enacted plan is near the central tendency of the alternatives in terms of compactness.\r\nHowever, it splits 11 counties whereas the alternative plans only split up to 6 counties.\r\n\r\nWhat are the redistricting rules used to generate simulated plans?\r\nWe have documented the rules we used to simulate our alternative plans.\r\nAll simulated plans will be contiguous, respect population equality, and are at least somewhat compact.\r\nMany states have their own specific rules, which we attempt to follow.\r\nThe set of constraints used depends on the state’s redistricting rules.\r\nHard county splitting constraint: Unless otherwise noted, a simulated plan will split fewer counties than the number of districts.\r\nHard population constraint: Congressional districts must be roughly equal in population, so all state simulations contain a user-specified cap on the maximum deviation of any one district from the target population, which is the total statewide population divided by the number of districts. This deviation is 0.5% of the target population or less, except when a state explicitly specifies a maximum.\r\nCompactness constraint: Unless otherwise noted, the algorithm nudges towards compact districts by an adjacency-graph-based measure of compactness, the fraction of edges kept.\r\nMunicipality splitting constraint: In some states, the simulations avoid splitting municipalities within large counties many times to preserve political subdivisions.\r\nVRA constraint: In some states, the simulations are encouraged to accept plans that have a concentrated minority share of the voting age population or citizen voting age population, in accordance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\r\nDisclaimers\r\nFor consistency, reference plans, such as the 2010 or 2020 enacted plans, are best matched to the VTD or tract level.\r\nReference plans often split a few of these at the block level.\r\nThis may have a very small impact on estimated metrics.\r\nFor example, NE’s 2010 plan has a very small county split which does not appear at the VTD level.\r\nVRA compliance requires substantial information, including a racially polarized voting analysis and knowledge of local history.\r\nFor the purposes of this project, we target the number of minority-opportunity districts as in the enacted plan.\r\nWe check approximate performance of these districts.\r\nSimulation results can change if different VRA constraints are imposed.\r\nConstraints are based on our interpretation of the law, but we are not lawyers.\r\nWe do our best to follow the requirements and choices made by states.\r\nAny suggestions for improving the analysis, including legal interpretation of statutory requirements are welcome and should be submitted as a GitHub issue.\r\nData Sources and Availability\r\nUnless otherwise noted, data for each state comes from the ALARM Project’s 2020 Redistricting Data Files, which use U.S.\r\nCensus demographic data (in the public domain) and election data from the Voting and Election Science Team, which is licensed under a CC BY 4.0 license.\r\nIn these cases, shapefiles are also taken from the U.S.\r\nCensus Bureau.\r\nThe U.S. map here, scaled to reflect Congressional representations, is courtesy of https://dkel.ec/map.\r\nAll data is available on our Dataverse and has been released to the public domain.\r\nCode is available on GitHub under an MIT license.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Comparing the partisan bias of a plan for Texas with the bias\r\nof a plan for New York, for example, is likely misleading. Comparing a\r\nstate’s current plan to a past plan is also problematic because of\r\ndemographic and political changes over time. Redistricting simulations\r\ngenerate an ensemble of alternative redistricting plans within a given\r\nstate which are tailored to its redistricting rules. Unlike traditional\r\nevaluation methods, therefore, simulations are able to directly account\r\nfor the state’s political geography and redistricting criteria.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the\r\nproject and our methodology »\r\nRead the data\r\npaper »\r\n\r\nYou can dive into our analyses straightaway by clicking on a state\r\nbelow. From there, you’ll be able to see how the state’s new\r\ncongressional districts stack up compared to a set of 5,000 simulated\r\nplans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStates colored  blue  have enacted a\r\ncongressional map and been fully analyzed, states colored  gray  have enacted a\r\nplan but haven’t yet been analyzed, or just have a single district (and\r\nhence no redistricting), and states colored  red  haven’t enacted\r\na plan yet.\r\n\r\nAnalyzed States\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlabama\r\n\r\n\r\nArizona\r\n\r\n\r\nArkansas\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia\r\n\r\n\r\nColorado\r\n\r\n\r\nConnecticut\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorida\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorgia\r\n\r\n\r\nHawaii\r\n\r\n\r\nIdaho\r\n\r\n\r\nIllinois\r\n\r\n\r\nIndiana\r\n\r\n\r\nIowa\r\n\r\n\r\nKansas\r\n\r\n\r\nKentucky\r\n\r\n\r\nLouisiana\r\n\r\n\r\nMaine\r\n\r\n\r\nMaryland\r\n\r\n\r\nMassachusetts\r\n\r\n\r\nMichigan\r\n\r\n\r\nMinnesota\r\n\r\n\r\nMississippi\r\n\r\n\r\nMissouri\r\n\r\n\r\nMontana\r\n\r\n\r\nNebraska\r\n\r\n\r\nNevada\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Jersey\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Mexico\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\nOhio\r\n\r\n\r\nOklahoma\r\n\r\n\r\nOregon\r\n\r\n\r\nPennsylvania\r\n\r\n\r\nRhode Island\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\nTennessee\r\n\r\n\r\nTexas\r\n\r\n\r\nUtah\r\n\r\n\r\nVirginia\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington\r\n\r\n\r\nWest Virginia\r\n\r\n\r\nWisconsin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor each state, we release 5,000 alternative plans, according to our\r\nbest approximation of each state’s redistricting rules. The code used to\r\ngenerate the simulated plans is also available so that others can use it\r\nas a template to generate their own simulated plans under different\r\nspecifications.  The major outputs are posted on the ALARM\r\nProject Dataverse, and the code is available on Github.). We\r\nhave also developed a package, alarmdata, which makes it easy to\r\ndownload and work with the simulation outputs in R.\r\n\r\nDownload the\r\ndata »\r\n\r\nOur simulation analyses should serve as a realistic template for\r\nthose who are interested in conducting their own analyses. Our code can\r\nbe modified and extended, and the resulting samples can be used to\r\nexplore various properties of potential plans under the specific\r\nredistricting criteria of our analysis. Our simulations presented here,\r\nhowever, do not represent our evaluation of the\r\nlegality of the enacted and other plans. Any such evaluation of\r\nthe enacted plan would require the interpretation of relevant laws.\r\nAlthough some requirements are relatively straightforward to interpret\r\nand operationalize (e.g., minimizing splits of administrative\r\nboundaries), others such as compliance with the Voting Rights Act\r\nrequire legal justifications. For this reason, we do not claim that the\r\nanalyses presented here are necessarily applicable when evaluating the\r\nlegality of redistricting plans.\r\nData Sources and\r\nAvailability\r\nUnless otherwise noted, data for each state comes from the ALARM\r\nProject’s 2020\r\nRedistricting Data Files, which use U.S. Census demographic data (in\r\nthe public domain) and election data from the Voting\r\nand Election Science Team, which is licensed under a CC BY 4.0\r\nlicense. In these cases, shapefiles are also taken from the U.S. Census\r\nBureau. The U.S. map here, scaled to reflect Congressional\r\nrepresentations, is courtesy of https://dkel.ec/map.\r\nAll data is available on our Dataverse and has been\r\nreleased to the public domain.
