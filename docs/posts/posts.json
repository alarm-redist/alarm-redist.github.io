    "contents": "\r\nThe Virginia Beach City Council\r\nVirginia Beach became an incorporated town in 1906 from Princess Anne County, and became an independent city in 1952. A legal battle with the City of Norfolk prompted a consolidation of the City of Virginia Beach with Princess Anne County again in 1962, forming the independent city of Virginia Beach.\r\nVirginia Beach is heavily influenced by the presence of the military. Apart from the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, Virginia Beach has the largest concentration of military personnel with 9 military installations from every branch of the US armed forces; this includes the largest naval base in the world. Thus, it has been classified by the American Communities Project as a military post: “middle-income, diverse communities, around military bases.”\r\nThere are 11 members in the Virginia Beach City Council. Ten members of the city council are elected in one of ten districts as shown in Figure 1. Displayed in Figure 2, three districts are currently Majority Minority Districts (MMDs), where the majority voting-eligible people in the district belong to a cohesive minority group.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Current Partisan Breakdown of City Council Members\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Majority Minority Districts in Virginia Beach City\r\n\r\nThe eleventh member is elected at-large to serve as the mayor of the city. While the council is legally nonpartisan, candidates with political affiliations emerged just seven years after the formation of the city council in 1963. Historical elections have been competitive between both Democrats and Republicans with a few declared independents, but the overall majority of the city council historically leaned Republican, especially prior to the 2022 court-ordered redistricting. The current 2023 City Council is comprised of six Democrats and five Republicans (Figure 1), with Republican Bobby Dyer serving as mayor. No candidates were up for reelection in the November 7, 2023 Virginia general election.\r\nTable 1: Current Virginia Beach City Council makeup. Majority-Minority Districts are italicized.\r\nMayor\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\nBobby Dyer (R)\r\nRocky Holcomb (R)\r\nBarbara M.

Census blocks, which are areas bounded by visible features such as roads or streams and invisible features such as property lines or other city/school districts, are visualized in Figure 4. These blocks help visualize where the city is located, as census blocks often follow city blocks in urban environments.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Map of Voting Precincts and City Council Boundaries in Virginia Beach City\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Map of Census Blocks and City Council Boundaries in Virginia Beach City\r\n\r\nDemographics & Partisan Breakdown\r\nVirginia Beach City has a population of 457,672 recorded in the 2020 US census, making it the largest independent city in Virginia and the 42nd largest in the United States. It is ranked by the Census Bureau as the 36th largest urban area; its metropolitan statistical area (MSA), the Hampton Roads MSA, is the 37th largest metropolitan area in the US. The overall demographic breakdown of the city is in the table below; population data is sourced from the 2020 Census and VAP/CVAP data is sourced from a count by the Virginia Department of Elections in the 2019 Virginia elections.\r\nTable 2: Demographic Breakdown of Virginia Beach, VA. in 2020\r\nDemographic\r\nPopulation\r\nVoting Age Pop.\r\nCitizen Voting Age Pop.\r\nWhite, non-Hispanic\r\n58.7%\r\n61.5%\r\n65.8%\r\nBlack, non-Hispanic\r\n20.1%\r\n20.1%\r\n19.7%\r\nAsian, non-Hispanic\r\n10%\r\n9.4%\r\n6.8%\r\nHispanic\r\n8.8%\r\n7.6%\r\n6.4%\r\nBlack + Hispanic + Asian\r\n40.5%\r\n37.2%\r\n32.8%\r\nFigure 5 shows the population density of the overall city to a precinct level. This is important for drawing city council boundaries, as per the Virginia Voting Rights Act, a district can only deviate from the average population in every district by 5%. However, how do we know who is actually eligible to vote? Figure 6 shows the percentage of the population in any given precinct that is of voting age, which is more indicative of current voter demographics.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Population Density by Precinct\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Percent Voting Age Population by Precinct\r\n\r\nFigures 7 and 8 show the percentage of minority and black populations by precinct. Districts 4, 7, and 10 are majority-minority districts (MMDs), shown in Figure 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Minority Population Percentage by Precinct\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Black Population Percentage by Precinct\r\n\r\nIn Virginia Beach City, minority populations tend to vote as a block for Democratic candidates. Figure 9 displays the vote percentage of Democrats and Republicans in each precinct; Democrats perform best in black/minority precincts. To quantify how cohesive a group of voters are, Figure 10 examines only precincts where the majority of residents in the precinct is a minority. The percentage of democratic votes in any given precinct trends similarly to the overall percentage of minority residents in the precinct, ranging from a .78 to 1.05 ratio.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9: Percent of Democratic Votes by Precinct. Color and percent indicate a precinct’s partisan tilt.\r\n\r\nFigure 10: Percent of Democratic Votes Compared to Minority Percentages in Majority-Minority Precincts\r\n\r\nRedistricting in Virginia Beach\r\nHolloway v. City of Virginia Beach, Va.\r\nIn 2017, Virginia Beach residents Latasha Holloway and Georgia Allen sued the City of Virginia Beach claiming that Virginia Beach’s current at-large method to elect council members violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by diluting the strength of minority votes in the legal case Holloway v. City of Virginia Beach, Va. Since 1998, Virginia Beach City Council members were elected in seven districts including three at-large council members; although candidates for one of the seven district seats had to reside in the district they were running for, all voting was conducted at-large. Residents of any district could vote in all seven district elections and the three at-large candidates.\r\nIn 2021, Virginia passed HB 2198, which prohibits local governments from using at-large voting for district elections. This led to the 2021 ruling in which the district court ruled that the at-large election method did violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by denying large minority groups in Virginia Beach (African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asians) equal access to political participation, and that those groups were politically cohesive. Although the City of Virginia Beach appealed the decision, the court proceeded by appointing a special master to create a remedial redistricting plan, established in this memo. This plan was adopted in 2022 before the November election after another round of appeals in the Fourth Circuit. The Virginia Beach School Board, which historically followed the same election system as the city council, voted in 2022 to adopt the same election system as the city council.\r\nIn 2022, the Fourth Circuit Appeals Court ruled in a 2-1 decision that the case should not have been considered by the district court, holding that HB 2198 already made the electoral system challenged by the plaintiffs illegal. This meant that the at-large electoral system no longer governed Virginia Beach City already and rendered the court case moot. The timing of the ruling meant that the redrawn maps and electoral system would be used in 2022, and could be modified if it met the requirements of the Virginia Voting Rights Act and HB 2198, both of which prevent at-large voting systems if they prevent minority groups from electing preferred candidates.\r\nThe makeup of the city council drastically shifted in the 2022 general election, the first local election under the 10-1 system. The council is the most diverse and youngest in city history, with four Black representatives and four members under 45. In all of the city council’s history since 1966, only four prior city council members were Black, and at most had two seats on the city council at any point in time. Democrats gained two seats on the city council, shifting the makeup from 6 GOP and 4 DEM with a GOP mayor in 2022 to 6 DEM and 4 GOP in 2023.\r\nAfter a round of public hearings over the new election system and a survey that showed 81% of residents supported the new system, the city council voted to adopt the 10-1 election system with the court-sanctioned district map on August 15th, 2023. Per Virginia state law, any new electoral system, such as 7 districts and 4 at-large, would require approval from the Virginia General Assembly to revise the charter, which at earliest could happen when the General Assembly reconvenes in January 2024.\r\nAnalysis\r\nDo the New Maps Gerrymander Minority Populations?\r\nAs the new maps include 3 majority-minority districts compared to a minority CVAP of 32.8%, we find that the new implemented maps do not gerrymander minority populations and are compliant with both the Virginia Voting Rights Act and the Federal Voting Rights Act.\r\nThe Virginia Voting Rights Act mandates that at-large local elections are banned if they dilute the voting power of minority populations. Instead, based on the percentage of the on the percentage of minorities in the citizen Voting Age Population and how cohesive minority voters are, minority opportunity districts would be created to protect minority voting power. Virginia Beach City has a cohesive democratic-leaning minority population that accounts for 32.8% of the citizen Voting Age Population. As there are 10 city council seats, three seats must be in MMDs.\r\nThe minority voting age population plot is displayed below. The graph orders each district from smaller to larger share of minority voting age population in each district. Each point represents one instance of a simulation, with the color of the point indicating if the district is projected to lean Democratic or Republican. The grey bars show the current ratified plan, showing that the current plan exceeds in creating three VAP districts. Notably, the enacted plan intentionally creates three solid majority-minority districts, demonstrated by the gap between the 7th and 8th districts.\r\nFigure 11: Simulated Majority Minority District CountsWe study the number of districts that are MMDs in any of the 200,000 plans. Total counts for MMDs in each simulation is displayed below:\r\nTable 3: Majority-Minority District appearance rate in 200,000 simulations\r\nCount of plans\r\n1 district\r\n2 districts\r\n3 districts\r\n4 districts\r\n5 districts\r\nExactly n districts\r\n95824\r\n88121\r\n13811\r\n2176\r\n68\r\nAt least n districts\r\n200000\r\n104176\r\n16055\r\n2244\r\n68\r\n% of simulations with at least n districts\r\n\r\n52.09%\r\n8.03%\r\n1.12%\r\n0.034%\r\nTable 4: Majority-Black District appearance rate in 200,000 simulations\r\nCount of plans\r\n0 districts\r\n1 districts\r\nExactly n districts\r\n143829\r\n56171\r\n% of simulations with at least n districts\r\n100%\r\n28.09%\r\nAs simulations usually only create one MMD (~88,000 simulations) or even none at all (~96,000 simulations), it is clear that the enacted plan intentionally upholds the need for three MMDs based on the Virginia Voting Rights Act.\r\n\r\nFigure 12: Percent of All Simulations Where the Precinct is in a Simualted MMD.\r\nDo the New Maps Have Partisan Gerrymandering?\r\nFigure 13: Democratic vote share by district in simulated runs. Black squares indicate the actual democratic vote share in the enacted plan, ordered by lowest to highest.Are the New Maps Competitive?\r\nFigure 14: Democratic vote share by district in simulated runs. Black squares indicate the actual democratic vote share in the enacted plan, ordered by lowest to highest.Methods and Materials\r\nData\r\nWe gathered election data from the 2022 U.S. House election that took place in Virginia Beach City. Although the house district encompasses other parts of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area, the Virginia election results website includes breakdowns for all the precincts in Virginia Beach City. The U.S. House was selected, as only the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th, and 10th city council districts elected a member under the new system in 2022. This makes a full analysis of the city council election unfeasible, as prior elections for city council still operated under the at-large voting system.\r\nBecause the Virginia Department of Elections differentiates between early vote (by mail and in-person) and election day vote results for each precinct, data was sourced from two places in the Virginia election results website:\r\n2022 November General Election Virginia Beach City House of Representatives Votes by Precinct\r\n2022 November General Election Virginia Beach City House of Representatives Absentee Voting by Precinct\r\nWe compile the specific data (Election Day, Early Voting, Mailed Absentee, Provisional, and Post-Election) to create overall vote splits by precinct. 249 write-in ballots, which constituted 0.15% of the total vote in Virginia Beach, are discarded.\r\nRuns and Simulations\r\nWe sample 20,000 districting plans for Virginia Beach City across fifteen independent runs of the Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm according to the relevant criteria. A summary of simulations can be found below.\r\nRedistricting Requirements\r\nPer Virginia and Federal law under Va. Code Ann. § 24.2-304.04 redistricting in Virginia Beach must:\r\nhave equal populations\r\nprovide opportunities for racial/ethnic representation\r\npreserve communities of interest (Va. Code Ann. § 24.2-304.04(5).)\r\nbe contiguous (Va. Code Ann. § 24.2-304.04(6).)\r\nbe compact (Va. Code Ann. § 24.2-304.04(7).)\r\nIn the 2021 Virginia Redistricting, the following requirements were considered in order of priority:\r\nbe contiguous, compact, and equal in population\r\npreserve existing political subdivisions\r\ncreate clearly discernible boundaries\r\nbe reasonably compact\r\nmaintain neighborhoods who share similar social, cultural, and economic interests\r\nConstraints\r\nThree constraints are added to simulations to promote districts that will either have a cohesive black voting age population above 55% or a small black voting age population. This keeps historically black communities together by discouraging districts that have a percentage of black voting-age population between 20-40%.\r\nA constraint is created that strongly promotes a plan where one district has a black voting age population of at least 55%.\r\nA constraint is created that discourages where the proportion of the black voting age population is less than 40%.\r\nA constraint is created that encourages districts where the black voting age population is less than 20%.\r\nNeighborhoods\r\nWe utilize elementary school attendance zones to preserve similar communities of interest. School zoning is effective as neighborhoods are often shaped by the school district; school districts often create cohesion in other neighborhood-adjacent indicators such as community and economics, as it affects home prices and who chooses to reside in any given neighborhood. We utilize the 55 elementary school attendance zones to serve as a de-facto neighborhood map. School attendance zones usually correlate with historic areas of a city/county, and elementary school attendance zones are small enough to be beneficial for redistricting simulations while encompassing 2-3 neighborhoods.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 15: Map of Voting Precincts and City Council Boundaries in Virginia Beach City\r\n\r\nFigure 16: Map of Voting Precincts and Elementary School Boundaries in Virginia Beach City\r\n\r\nThese zones are necessary as neighborhoods are important for redistricting simulations; neighborhoods help make contiguous districts that account for community boundaries to avoid splitting a community between different districts. However, neighborhoods are difficult to find in Virginia Beach City, partially because the city fully incorporates Princess Anne County. Unlike other cities such as Phoenix, AZ, the city does not maintain any officially designated neighborhood or borough subdivision of the city. Various real estate agents maintain neighborhood designations, but they all have certain downsides:\r\nZiemer Real Estate’s neighborhoods are too large for use in preserving boundaries and have spots without neighborhoods\r\nLayton Realty Group’s neighborhoods are small and based on historic boundaries, but only cover the original area of Virginia Beach City\r\nCity-Data only has four tiny recorded neighborhoods for Virginia Beach City\r\nWe explore various other alternatives:\r\nZip codes were considered, but as there are only 20 zip codes in Virginia Beach City with odd shapes, using zip codes worsened the diversity (number of different simulated plans) in simulation outcomes\r\nCensus block maps were also considered, but are intentionally arbitrary to maintain similarly sized blocks across the United States and split neighborhoods\r\nUltimately, elementary school zoning serves as the most detailed indicator compared to sparse neighborhood data.\r\nSummary of Simulations\r\n\r\nFrom the validation plot of our simulations, we see that our simulation ranges around the same level of compactness as the enacted plan. Simulated plans are diverse, but push against the generally acceptable boundary of a maximum 5% population deviation between districts and vary greatly in neighborhood splits. One observation is that the enacted plan packs minority voters into three districts, which was motivated by a substantially lower citizen minority voter population across Virginia Beach City. In effect, minorities in the three districts lie around a 51-53% citizen VAP majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This paper is the first independent evaluation of effects of the Census Bureau’s privacy protection on noise and bias in released counts. We leverage the recent release of the Noisy Measurements file (NMF) to evaluate both swapping and the newer TopDown algorithm.\r\nWe find that:\r\nthe NMF is too noisy to use alone, but the post-processing step of the TopDown algorithm reduces error substantially, making the post-processed data as accurate as swapping.\r\nerrors from privacy protection methods are generally smaller than other sources of census errors, they can be substantial for census geographies with small populations.\r\nthe average bias is fairly low across groups, but there is more uncertainty and noise for Hispanic and multiracial people.

We conduct the first independent evaluation of bias and noise induced by the Bureau’s two main disclosure avoidance systems: the TopDown algorithm employed for the 2020 nsus and the swapping algorithm implemented for the 1990, 2000, and 2010 Censuses. Our evaluation leverages the recent release of the Noisy Measure File (NMF) as well as the availability of two independent runs of the TopDown algorithm applied to the 10 decennial Census. We find that the NMF contains too much noise to be directly useful alone, especially for Hispanic and multiracial populations. TopDown’s post-processing dramatically reduces the NMF noise and produces similarly accurate data to swapping in terms of bias and noise. These patterns hold across census geographies with varying population sizes and racial diversity. While the estimated errors for both TopDown and swapping are generally no larger than other sources of Census error, they can be relatively substantial for geographies with small total populations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nToday, our paper Widespread Partisan Gerrymandering Mostly Cancels Nationally, but Reduces Electoral Competition was published in PNAS.\r\nWe evaluate partisan gerrymandering nationwide for new 2020 districts using simulated maps that account for geography and state-specific rules. We find evidence that gerrymandering is widespread across states, resulting in disadvantages for the Democratic party and less competitive districts. Read the abstract below:\r\n\r\nRedistricting plans in legislatures determine how voters’ preferences are translated into representative’s seats. Political parties may manipulate the redistricting process to gain additional seats and insulate incumbents from electoral competition, a process known as gerrymandering. But detecting gerrymandering is difficult without a representative set of alternative plans that comply with the same geographic and legal constraints. Harnessing recent algorithmic advances in sampling, we study such a collection of alternative redistricting plans that can serve as a non-partisan baseline. This methodological approach can distinguish electoral bias due to partisan effects from electoral bias due to other factors. We find that Democrats are structurally and geographically disadvantaged in House elections by 8 seats, while partisan gerrymandering disadvantages them by 2 seats.\r\n\r\nIf you’re interested in further details on this research project, take a look at the Supplementary Information or our replication data.\r\nThis research would not be possible without the 50-State Redistricting Simulations.

This article evaluates the partisan effects of redistricting in 2020 using simulations, allowing us to account for both compliance with legal requirements and the effects of political geography. While many individual state plans are biased in favor of one party or the other, the US House plan for 2022 is relatively unbiased. However, many districts are quite a bit less competitive than would be typically expected.\r\nA pre-print of the article is available on arXiv.\r\nWe are grateful to the editors and reviewers for their helpful feedback in improving this paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nIt’s been a while since redist 4.0 was released and things have been fairly stable. Most of the changes in this release are behind-the-scenes improvements that shouldn’t break your workflow, but should improve your experience using the package.\r\nTo install version 4.1, get the new version from CRAN:\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall.packages('redist')\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Features\r\nExtends the ordered box/jitter plots to custom ordered geometries in redist.plot.distr_qtys()\r\nBetter diagnostic outputs for summary.redist_plans()\r\nImproved confidence intervals with redist_ci()\r\nC++ improvements for sampling more quickly\r\nBetter sampling efficiency in SMC’s final stage\r\nQuicker random walks for SMC and merge-split.\r\nFaster random number generation. (It’s small, but it adds up!)\r\n\r\nPlotting Flexibility with redist.plot.distr_qtys()\r\nBox-and-whiskers plots are great and useful in many situations. In redistricting, we’ve often used ordered boxplots. These order the x-axis by the quantity on the x-axis. Sometimes, a boxplot throws away information that you might care about, though.\r\n>Is the distribution multi-modal? Where are the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles for a confidence interval?\r\nNow, you can take those questions into your own hands with adjustments to arguments in redist.plot.distr_qtys()!\r\nLet’s build this out a bit. First, we’ll use some data from the 50-State Redistricting Simulations via the alarmdata package.\r\nWe can get the redist_map and corresponding 5,000 sampled plus the enacted plans in a redist_plans object for Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(redist)\r\nlibrary(alarmdata)\r\nmap <- alarm_50state_map('MI')\r\nplans <- alarm_50state_plans('MI')\r\n\r\n\r\nplans here has a column e_dvs that gives the expected Democratic vote share for each district in each plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nredist.plot.distr_qtys(plans, qty = e_dvs)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe’ve always been able to clean or augment this plot up using regular ggplot2 things:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\n\r\nredist.plot.distr_qtys(plans, qty = e_dvs) + \r\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = 'dotted') + \r\n    scale_y_continuous(name = 'Expected Dem. Vote Share', labels = scales::label_percent(), \r\n                       limits = c(0.25, 0.95), breaks = seq(0.2, 0.9, by = 0.1)) +\r\n    theme_bw()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can draw clear conclusions here, like that districts 2, 3, and 4 are abnormally packed with Republicans compared to what we might normally see when drawing districts that follow the state’s redistricting rules. We might not be able to get all of the information out of this plot that we want, beyond which districts are clear outliers.\r\nNow, if we made it a box plot instead of a jitter plot, as the points can be overwhelming, we can still draw the same major conclusions, and we now have a more formal idea of outliers that don’t just sit above or below the data. Things like district 6 can be still be a bit unclear. Is district 6 in the outlier range or are the points just big on this small plot?\r\n\r\n\r\nredist.plot.distr_qtys(plans, qty = e_dvs, geom = 'boxplot') + \r\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = 'dotted') + \r\n    scale_y_continuous(name = 'Expected Dem. Vote Share', labels = scales::label_percent(), \r\n                       limits = c(0.25, 0.95), breaks = seq(0.2, 0.9, by = 0.1)) +\r\n    theme_bw()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA first thing we might consider doing is to use a violin plot instead of a boxplot, as that doesn’t summarize distributional information in the same way as a box plot. This is now really easy, just pass ggplot2::geom_violin as an argument to geom.\r\n\r\n\r\nredist.plot.distr_qtys(plans, qty = e_dvs, geom = ggplot2::geom_violin) + \r\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = 'dotted') + \r\n    scale_y_continuous(name = 'Expected Dem. Vote Share', labels = scales::label_percent(), \r\n                       limits = c(0.25, 0.95), breaks = seq(0.2, 0.9, by = 0.1)) +\r\n    theme_bw()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defaults here don’t always play the best though, so we might want to also change the reference geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\nr_geom <- function(...) \r\n    ggplot2::geom_segment(\r\n        ggplot2::aes(x = as.integer(.distr_no) - 0.5,\r\n                     xend = as.integer(.distr_no) + 0.5,\r\n                     yend = e_dvs,\r\n                     color = .data$draw),\r\n        ...\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\nThis immediately gets a bit more complicated. For this to work, we need to know a few things:\r\nThe function has to take ... as an argument.\r\nInternally, the variable we are plotting on the x is going to be called .distr_no.\r\nThe reference geometry will inherit x = .distr_no by default and y = qty, for whatever your input to qty is.\r\nThe above then says, on the x-axis, we want a line from the district - 0.5 to the district + 0.5, while we set yend = e_dvs to match the implicitly set y = e_dvs, since we passed qty = e_dvs before.\r\n\r\n\r\nredist.plot.distr_qtys(plans, qty = e_dvs, geom = ggplot2::geom_violin, ref_geom = r_geom) + \r\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = 'dotted') + \r\n    scale_y_continuous(name = 'Expected Dem. Vote Share', labels = scales::label_percent(), \r\n                       limits = c(0.25, 0.95), breaks = seq(0.2, 0.9, by = 0.1)) +\r\n    theme_bw()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good thing here is that we can adjust the ref_geom however we see fit at this point. So if that red line is too dark, but also too skinny, we can do something like changing the alpha:\r\n\r\n\r\nr_geom <- function(...) \r\n    ggplot2::geom_segment(\r\n        ggplot2::aes(x = as.integer(.distr_no) - 0.5,\r\n                     xend = as.integer(.distr_no) + 0.5,\r\n                     yend = e_dvs,\r\n                     color = .data$draw),\r\n        linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.7,\r\n        ...\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\nThen this fixes those particular issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nredist.plot.distr_qtys(plans, qty = e_dvs, geom = ggplot2::geom_violin, ref_geom = r_geom) + \r\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = 'dotted') + \r\n    scale_y_continuous(name = 'Expected Dem. Vote Share', labels = scales::label_percent(), \r\n                       limits = c(0.25, 0.95), breaks = seq(0.2, 0.9, by = 0.1)) +\r\n    theme_bw()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, there are tons of other things we can do here. If we want to revisit the 95% confidence interval issue, we can turn to ggdist.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(ggdist)\r\n\r\nredist.plot.distr_qtys(plans, qty = e_dvs, geom = stat_pointinterval, ref_geom = r_geom) + \r\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = 'dotted') + \r\n    scale_y_continuous(name = 'Expected Dem. Vote Share', labels = scales::label_percent(), \r\n                       limits = c(0.25, 0.95), breaks = seq(0.2, 0.9, by = 0.1)) +\r\n    theme_bw()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, we have really clear idea of how wide the 95% confidence interval goes (via the length of the skinny lines).\r\nAnd really, the sky is the limit with packages like ggdist. For example, if we want a raincloud, we can do that.\r\n\r\n\r\nraincloud <- function(...) {\r\n    list(\r\n        ggdist::stat_slab(aes(thickness = ggplot2::after_stat(pdf*n)), scale = 1),\r\n        ggdist::stat_dotsinterval(side = \"bottom\", scale = 1,\r\n                                  slab_size = NA, quantiles = 100)\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nThis gives us a fun plot to work with, though this might be best suited for much larger plot areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nredist.plot.distr_qtys(plans, qty = e_dvs, geom = raincloud, ref_geom = r_geom) + \r\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = 'dotted') + \r\n    scale_y_continuous(name = 'Expected Dem. Vote Share', labels = scales::label_percent(), \r\n                       limits = c(0.35, 0.95), breaks = seq(0.2, 0.9, by = 0.1)) +\r\n    theme_bw()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter Diagnostics for summary.redist_plans()\r\nLike above, let’s get some simulated plans from the 50-State Redistricting Simulations. We can get a state like Nevada, which has fewer districts and shorter summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(alarmdata)\r\nplans <- alarm_50state_plans('NV')\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get diagnostics, we can call summary(plans) which computes R-hats, sample diversity, and some split-by-split SMC diagnostics.\r\n\r\n\r\nsummary(plans)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR-hat values for summary statistics:\r\n   pop_overlap      total_vap       plan_dev      comp_edge \r\n         1.003          1.003          1.001          1.000 \r\n   comp_polsby       pop_hisp      pop_white      pop_black \r\n         1.000          1.009          1.005          1.003 \r\n      pop_aian      pop_asian       pop_nhpi      pop_other \r\n         1.002          1.003          1.000          1.003 \r\n       pop_two       vap_hisp      vap_white      vap_black \r\n         1.003          1.007          1.006          1.004 \r\n      vap_aian      vap_asian       vap_nhpi      vap_other \r\n         1.001          1.002          1.000          1.007 \r\n       vap_two pre_16_dem_cli pre_16_rep_tru uss_16_dem_cor \r\n         1.003          1.001          1.003          1.000 \r\nuss_16_rep_hec uss_18_dem_ros uss_18_rep_hel gov_18_dem_sis \r\n         1.004          1.002          1.002          1.002 \r\ngov_18_rep_lax atg_18_dem_for atg_18_rep_dun sos_18_dem_ara \r\n         1.003          1.001          1.002          1.001 \r\nsos_18_rep_ceg pre_20_dem_bid pre_20_rep_tru         arv_16 \r\n         1.003          1.002          1.004          1.003 \r\n        adv_16         arv_18         adv_18         arv_20 \r\n         1.000          1.003          1.002          1.004 \r\n        adv_20  county_splits    muni_splits            ndv \r\n         1.002          1.002          1.003          1.002 \r\n           nrv        ndshare          e_dvs         pr_dem \r\n         1.003          1.003          1.003          1.001 \r\n         e_dem          pbias           egap \r\n         1.002          1.000          1.001 \r\n\r\n         Eff. samples (%) Acc. rate Log wgt. sd  Max. unique Est. k \r\nSplit 1     2,215 (88.6%)     19.7%        0.93 1,583 (100%)     10 \r\nSplit 2     2,287 (91.5%)     12.8%        0.51 1,565 ( 99%)      6 \r\nSplit 3     2,242 (89.7%)      5.9%        0.56 1,441 ( 91%)      4 \r\nResample    1,352 (54.1%)       NA%        0.57 1,409 ( 89%)     NA \r\n\r\n         Eff. samples (%) Acc. rate Log wgt. sd  Max. unique Est. k \r\nSplit 1     2,228 (89.1%)     15.1%        0.91 1,584 (100%)     13 \r\nSplit 2     2,285 (91.4%)      9.7%        0.52 1,574 (100%)      8 \r\nSplit 3     2,236 (89.4%)      5.0%        0.58 1,444 ( 91%)      5 \r\nResample    1,471 (58.8%)       NA%        0.59 1,399 ( 89%)     NA \r\n\r\nThe first big change here is that the digits are now rounded to three digits.\r\nYou no longer need to search through 8 decimal digits at 3am for the ones that matter.\r\nTypically, we want R-hat values between 1 and 1.05, so this looks pretty good.\r\nWhat if they weren’t?

We discuss boyd and Sarathy (2022), addressing both factual inaccuracies in their work and their contention that disagreements over privacy in the 2020 Census are primarily academic issues.\r\n\r\nIn “Differential Perspectives: Epistemic Disconnects Surrounding the U.S. Census Bureau’s Use of Differential Privacy,” boyd and Sarathy argue that empirical evaluations of the Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS), including our published analysis (Kenny et al., 2021b), failed to recognize that the benchmark data against which the 2020 DAS was evaluated is never a ground truth of population counts. In this commentary, we explain why policy evaluation, which was the main goal of our analysis, is still meaningful without access to a perfect ground truth. We also point out that our evaluation leveraged features specific to the decennial census and redistricting data, such as block-level population invariance under swapping and voter file racial identification, better approximating a comparison with the ground truth. Lastly, we show that accurate statistical predictions of individual race based on the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding, while not a violation of differential privacy, substantially increases the disclosure risk of private information the Census Bureau sought to protect. We conclude by arguing that policymakers must confront a key trade-off between data utility and privacy protection, and an epistemic disconnect alone is insufficient to explain disagreements between policy choices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The package allows users to test for illegal partisan and racial\r\ngerrymandering, a timely and important question in the wake of the 2020\r\nCensus and the redistricting cycle that followed. It has had a\r\nsubstantial policy impact seeing use in legal challenges against and,\r\nunusually, has also been cited by six Supreme Court justices in oral\r\narguments. In short, it is an ideal recipient of the Society for\r\nPolitical Methodolgy’s 2022 Statistical Software Award.\r\n\r\nWe are grateful for the honor! Thank you to the award committee for\r\nconsidering our software.\r\nredist is an open source R package for sampling\r\nredistricting plans, available here:\r\n\r\nThis R package enables researchers to sample redistricting plans from\r\na pre-specified target distribution using Sequential Monte Carlo and\r\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The package supports various\r\nconstraints in the redistricting process, such as geographic compactness\r\nand population parity requirements. Tools for analysis, including\r\ncomputation of various summary statistics and plotting functionality,\r\nare also included.\r\n\r\nredist is a key tool for much of our work, which has\r\nenabled work on identifying\r\nbias in Census 2020, creating\r\nalternative plans for all 50 states, reducing\r\nmalapportionment in Japan, assessing\r\npartisan bias in 2022’s congressional districts, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Gerrymandering in\r\n2020 redistricting makes the US House elections less competitive, but\r\nnet seat gains are small nationally. The abstract below highlights\r\nmore of our findings.\r\n\r\nCongressional district lines in many U.S. states are drawn by\r\npartisan actors, raising concerns about gerrymandering. To isolate the\r\nelectoral impact of gerrymandering from the effects of other factors\r\nincluding geography and redistricting rules, we compare predicted\r\nelection outcomes under the enacted plan with those under a large sample\r\nof non-partisan, simulated alternative plans for all states. We find\r\nthat partisan gerrymandering is widespread in the 2020 redistricting\r\ncycle, but most of the bias it creates cancels at the national level,\r\ngiving Republicans two additional seats, on average. In contrast,\r\nmoderate pro-Republican bias due to geography and redistricting rules\r\nremains. Finally, we find that partisan gerrymandering reduces electoral\r\ncompetition and makes the House’s partisan composition less responsive\r\nto shifts in the national vote.\r\n\r\nAll in all, most of the states you thought were gerrymandered are\r\nindeed gerrymandered.\r\nSome gerrymandered states that you might have missed include those\r\ndrawn by commissions (like Michigan and Iowa) and those drawn by courts\r\n(like Pennsylvania and North Carolina). The state-by-state results are\r\nbelow, with a national topline that the US map favors Republicans by\r\nabout two seats beyond what’s explained by geography, on average.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can take this further and look at a partisan manipulation\r\nmap. Each district is colored by the difference in probability that\r\nit is represented by a Republican or Democrat in the enacted from the\r\nsimulated plans. Red areas favor Republicans over simulations, blue\r\nareas favor Democrats over simulations. The darkness of each district\r\nrepresents the intensity of that difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re interested in more information on our findings or methods,\r\ntake a look here.\r\nA special thank you to George Garcia III, Kevin Wang, and Melissa Wu\r\nfor their contributions to the 50stateSimulations which\r\nmade this research possible.\r\n\r\nIn case you missed it, we\r\nhave a blog post introducing those simulations and their\r\ncontributors.↩︎\r\n",

We are now finalizing some re-runs of states\r\nwith new validation steps based on additional diagnostics, to ensure a\r\nhigh quality and accurate data product. So, we’ve written up a more\r\ndetailed draft of what we did, how we did it, and how we checked our\r\nwork. Most importantly, it introduces some tools so that you can use the\r\ndata we’ve generated. It’s all open source and the redistricting plans\r\ngenerated are in the public domain.\r\nRead the detailed description of the our process and the data: Simulated redistricting plans\r\nfor the analysis and evaluation of redistricting in the United States:\r\n50stateSimulations. The abstract is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis article introduces the 50stateSimulations, a collection of\r\nsimulated congressional districting plans and underlying code developed\r\nby the Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology (ALARM) Project. The\r\n50stateSimulations allow for the evaluation of enacted and other\r\ncongressional redistricting plans in the United States. While the use of\r\nredistricting simulation algorithms has become standard in academic\r\nresearch and court cases, any simulation analysis requires non-trivial\r\nefforts to combine multiple data sets, identify state-specific\r\nredistricting criteria, implement complex simulation algorithms, and\r\nsummarize and visualize simulation outputs. We have developed a complete\r\nworkflow that facilitates this entire process of simulation-based\r\nredistricting analysis for the congressional districts of all 50 states.\r\nThe resulting 50stateSimulations include ensembles of simulated 2020\r\ncongressional redistricting plans and necessary replication data. We\r\nalso provide the underlying code, which serves as a template for\r\ncustomized analyses. All data and code are free and publicly available.\r\nThis article details the design, creation, and validation of the\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nTo help make things more usable for those who don’t simulate\r\nredistricting plans in their free time, we are also excited to (soft)\r\nlaunch a new R package, alarmdata.\r\nThis package provides a simplified interface to download the underlying\r\ngeographic data, generated plans, all sorts of summary statistics, and\r\nstate-by-state documentation.\r\nThe package can be installed with:\r\n\r\n\r\nremotes::install_github('alarm-redist/alarmdata')\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you to the Harvard Data Science Initiative and Microsoft for\r\ncomputational support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This factor should\r\nnot have an effect on substantive conclusions and summary\r\nstatistics.\r\nRemove deprecated functions\r\nMany bug fixes (see https://github.com/alarm-redist/redist/issues)\r\nUpdated Features: A Brief\r\nDemo\r\nThe first thing you’ll notice upon loading redist is\r\nthat it also loads redistmetrics.\r\nredistmetrics used to live within redist but\r\nhas been separated to keep the package size reasonable and to make the\r\nindividual compile times shorter.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(redist)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can pull in some\r\ndata from the ALARM Project, which combines 2020 Census data with VEST’s\r\nelection data, retabulated to 2020 voting districts. For this example,\r\nwe can use data from New Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nnm <- geomander::get_alarm('NM')\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can then make a redist_map for New Mexico.1\r\n\r\n\r\nmap_nm <- redist_map(nm, ndists = 3, pop_tol = 0.005)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd we can begin with a basic run of redist_smc to\r\nsample 1000 plans using the sampler from Sequential Monte Carlo for\r\nSampling Balanced and Compact Redistricting Plans by Cory McCartan and Kosuke Imai. Most importantly,\r\nredist_smc now offers an argument for the number of\r\nindependent sampling runs. For now, we can break that 1000 plans into 2\r\nruns of 500.\r\n\r\n\r\nset.seed(2022)\r\nplans <- redist_smc(map = map_nm, nsims = 500, runs = 2, counties = county)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new messages above are created with cli to more make\r\nmessage printing cleaner and more consistent.\r\nTo the output, we can add some basic summary information using\r\navailable redistmetrics functions, automatically loaded by\r\nredist.\r\n\r\n\r\nplans <- plans %>% \r\n    mutate(\r\n        frac_kept = comp_frac_kept(plans = ., shp = map_nm),\r\n        dvs_gov_18 = part_dvs(plans = ., shp = map_nm, dvote = gov_18_dem_luj, rvote = gov_18_rep_pea),\r\n        county_spl = splits_admin(plans = ., shp = map_nm, admin = county)\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order, this adds the Fraction Kept compactness score, the\r\nDemocratic two-party vote share in the 2018 Governor’s race, and the\r\nnumber of counties split.\r\nNow, the plans object has a few new columns:\r\n\r\n\r\nhead(plans)\r\n\r\n\r\nWith plans resampled from weights\r\nPlans matrix: int [1:1977, 1:1000] 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\r\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\r\n  draw  chain district total_pop frac_kept dvs_gov_18 county_spl\r\n  <fct> <int>    <int>     <dbl>     <dbl>      <dbl>      <int>\r\n1 1         1        1    706220     0.984      0.474          2\r\n2 1         1        2    707900     0.984      0.602          2\r\n3 1         1        3    703402     0.984      0.619          2\r\n4 2         1        1    707157     0.990      0.508          2\r\n5 2         1        2    706801     0.990      0.582          2\r\n6 2         1        3    703564     0.990      0.616          2\r\n\r\nDraw, chain, and district identify each plan, where\r\nchain is new to 4.0 for SMC. It signifies the SMC run,\r\nsimilar to how redist_mergesplit_parallel indicates the\r\nchain from merge-split. Despite this, we can use the normal plotting\r\nfunctions on the redist_plans object. If we load\r\npatchwork here to get a nice row of ggplots,\r\nwe see the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(patchwork)\r\nhist(plans, frac_kept) + \r\n    plot(plans, dvs_gov_18) + \r\n    hist(plans, county_spl)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese plots are fairly standard. The exciting thing is that we can\r\nnow call summary() to get diagnostic information about the\r\nruns of SMC. We can call this on any redist_plans object\r\nand it will adjust the output information depending on what algorithm\r\ngenerated the plans.\r\n\r\n\r\nsummary(plans)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR-hat values for summary statistics:\r\n frac_kept dvs_gov_18 county_spl \r\n   1.00259    1.00197    0.99955 \r\n\r\n         Eff. samples (%) Acc. rate Log wgt. sd  Max. unique Est. k \r\nSplit 1       485 (97.0%)      9.9%        0.38   469 ( 94%)     10 \r\nSplit 2       474 (94.9%)      5.3%        0.48   397 ( 79%)      6 \r\nResample      411 (82.2%)       NA%        0.48   417 ( 83%)     NA \r\n\r\n         Eff. samples (%) Acc. rate Log wgt. sd  Max. unique Est. k \r\nSplit 1       482 (96.5%)     12.2%        0.41   471 ( 94%)      8 \r\nSplit 2       476 (95.3%)      6.7%        0.46   405 ( 81%)      5 \r\nResample      417 (83.4%)       NA%        0.45   419 ( 84%)     NA \r\n\r\nEach R-hat value is below 1.05, so we do not get any warnings. At a\r\nhigh level, this means that both runs of SMC are sampling from regions\r\ncomparable by these three summary statistics. That isn’t always the case\r\nthough. If you do get a warning, you should increase the number of\r\nsimulations or decrease the constraint strengths.\r\nWe next introduce the new constraint interface. To initialize a\r\nconstraint, we call redist_constr, which takes a\r\nredist_map input.\r\n\r\n\r\nconstr <- redist_constr(map = map_nm)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can add any of the many constraints available with\r\n?constraints. There are many new constraints to people who\r\nhave only used redist_smc/redist_mergesplit or\r\nredist_flip before. Now all constraints are available to\r\nall algorithms. Additionally, we can write pretty much any constraint\r\nthat we can map to the positive reals, using the new custom\r\nconstraint.\r\nFor our custom constraint, we just care that the 100th row of\r\nmap_nm won’t be assigned to district 3. We can do the\r\nfollowing\r\n\r\n\r\nconstr <- constr %>% \r\n    add_constr_custom(\r\n        strength = 10,\r\n        fn = function(plan, distr) {\r\n            as.numeric(plan[100] != 3)\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis takes an R function fn and a strength value (how\r\nmuch to multiply the output of fn by). The fn\r\ninput should always take the form\r\nfunction(plan, distr) { ... }, where plan will\r\nbe an integer matrix of precinct-district assignments and\r\ndistr will be the current district.\r\nWe can then pass constr to the constraints\r\nargument in redist_smc().\r\n\r\n\r\nset.seed(2022)\r\nplans <- redist_smc(map = map_nm, nsims = 500, runs = 2, counties = county, \r\n                    constraints = constr)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, we add some summary statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\nplans <- plans %>% \r\n    mutate(\r\n        frac_kept = comp_frac_kept(plans = ., shp = map_nm),\r\n        dvs_gov_18 = part_dvs(plans = ., shp = map_nm, dvote = gov_18_dem_luj, rvote = gov_18_rep_pea),\r\n        county_spl = splits_admin(plans = ., shp = map_nm, admin = county)\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen run the diagnostics:\r\n\r\n\r\nsummary(plans)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR-hat values for summary statistics:\r\n frac_kept dvs_gov_18 county_spl \r\n   0.99916    1.00000    1.00845 \r\n\r\n         Eff. samples (%) Acc. rate Log wgt. sd  Max. unique Est. k \r\nSplit 1       484 (96.8%)     10.9%        0.38   475 ( 95%)     10 \r\nSplit 2       476 (95.1%)      5.7%        0.46   399 ( 80%)      6 \r\nResample      413 (82.6%)       NA%        0.46   407 ( 81%)     NA \r\n\r\n         Eff. samples (%) Acc. rate Log wgt. sd  Max. unique Est. k \r\nSplit 1       483 (96.6%)     12.8%        0.40   478 ( 96%)      8 \r\nSplit 2       477 (95.4%)      7.3%        0.45   388 ( 78%)      5 \r\nResample      419 (83.8%)       NA%        0.45   420 ( 84%)     NA \r\n\r\nAnd everything looks good. Despite adding a constraint, the sample\r\nstill looks fine under these summary statistics.\r\nFor more information on diagnostics, take a look at McCartan and Imai\r\n(2022).\r\n\r\nFor a very brief intro to\r\nredist_maps, see the 3.0 release post at https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-04-02-redist-300/.↩︎\r\n",

table contains several identification columns, a set of census-derived\r\ndemographic columns, and a set of VEST-derived election columns.\r\nGEOID20 is the unique identifier for a precinct or Census block.\r\nThe state and county of the precinct or block are also provided.\r\nCensus variables are prefixed with pop_ or vap_, depending on whether\r\nthey are for the entire population or the voting-age population.\r\nSuffixes refer to racial and ethnic categories, as follows:\r\n_hisp: Hispanic or Latino (of any race)\r\n_white: White alone, not Hispanic or Latino\r\n_black: Black or African American alone, not Hispanic or Latino\r\n_aian: American Indian and Alaska Native alone, not Hispanic or Latino\r\n_asian: Asian alone, not Hispanic or Latino\r\n_nhpi: Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, not Hispanic or Latino\r\n_other: Some Other Race alone, not Hispanic or Latino\r\n_two: Population of two or more races, not Hispanic or Latino\r\n\r\nElection variables consist of average vote counts for Democratic and\r\nRepublican candidates. The adv_## and arv_## columns report the\r\naverage vote count in the ## election, across all statewide races\r\ncontested by both parties. The ndv and nrv columns further average\r\nthe vote counts across all available election years. For specific statewide\r\nraces, you may download the files in vest-2020/ and join them to the data\r\nusing the GEOID20 column.\r\nMore Tools\r\nFor redistricting and voting rights analysis, we recommend the\r\nredist package.\r\nFor pre-processing and tidying data for redistricting analysis, we recommend the\r\ngeomander package.\r\nFor more custom tabulations of the 2020 census data, we recommend the\r\nPL94171 package.\r\nFor general-purpose census data processing, we recommend the\r\ncensable package.\r\nFor alternate data unaffected by Census differential privacy, you may want to\r\nconsider FCC block-level estimates, available using the\r\nblockpop package.\r\nTechnical notes\r\nTo produce election data using 2020 precinct boundaries, election results were\r\nprojected down to the 2010 block level using voting-age population as weights.\r\nResults for 2020 blocks were then estimated using 2010 blocks and the\r\nland-use-based crosswalk files\r\nfrom VEST. Finally, 2020 blocks were aggregated to 2020 precincts using the\r\nCensus’ 2020 block assignment files.\r\n2010 Data Addendum\r\nIf you are looking for a similar construction for 2010 data, please see here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nOn June 9, The Census Bureau released information on their final parameters for the 2020 Census data release. We are grateful that they have incorporated some of the recommendations from our report to help build a better data product for redistricting.\r\nThe Bureau has made several welcome changes. They state that they have updated the post-processing component of the Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) to address the undercounting bias in racially and ethnically diverse areas, which we reported in our analysis. As we recommended, the Bureau has also increased the privacy-loss budget, allocating the increase towards more accurate population and racial counts on geographies at the block group level and higher. We are hopeful that this targeted increase will help attenuate the DAS- induced population change at the voting district and precinct level.\r\nSome unresolved issues remain, however. The Bureau indicates that a new demonstration data product will not be released until September. Yet they plan to first release 2020 census redistricting data, which we expect states and localities to begin using immediately, by August 16, 2021.1 Given the timing, it is unclear how the evaluation of the new demonstration data will affect the upcoming redistricting process and related litigation.  The Bureau also states that there will be no direct increases in accuracy for block-level data, in order to protect privacy.  As this is a key aspect of ensuring the equality of vote and protecting the principle of One Person, One Vote, map drawers and analysts may have to adjust their interpretation of this long-standing principle.\r\nThe Bureau also announced that they plan to release the final version of the DAS code base.  This is an important step for transparency. However, the code alone does not allow analysts to evaluate the impacts of DAS on redistricting and properly account for the additional uncertainty due to the injected noise. We recommend the Bureau also release differentially private noisy population counts that have not been subject to the post-processing steps, as well as parameter values used for noise generation. Although scholarly communities have not fully resolved the issue of incorporating additional noise into redistricting simulation analysis, the availability of such information should facilitate future methodological development. In particular, it is of interest to examine whether or not the additional noise makes it more difficult to detect partisan and racial gerrymandering.\r\n\r\nCaliper, who makes the software Maptitude for Redistricting, has announced they will process the legacy format data, and two ALARM Project members have created an R package to process legacy data as well. These types of resources should allow people to immediately begin drawing maps.↩︎\r\n",

Doesn’t the Census itself already have enumeration error?\r\n\r\nWe have received a large number of questions and suggestions since releasing the first version of our report on Friday, May 28th. After meeting the Census Bureau’s one month deadline to produce comments on DAS-protected data, we are continuing to undertake additional analyses of the impacts of DAS on the redistricting process and analyses. We are working towards releasing the revised report soon. In the meantime, we provide our current answers to the questions frequently asked by others below.\r\nAre you advocating for the use of swapping methods over differential privacy as a method of privacy protection?\r\nNo. We have not studied the impact of swapping on redistricting. It is well known that differential privacy (DP) is theoretically superior to swapping in terms of privacy protection. The key policy question is how much privacy protection we would want at the expense of accurate census measurements. We argue that when changing an important public policy, such as whether additional noise should be added to the census, one needs to carefully determine the impacts of such policy change. We do not argue against DP and believe additional privacy protections to be a worthy consideration for some of the Census variables and products. However, we find that the current implementation of DAS can lead to substantively important changes in redistricting outcomes while also not meaningfully protecting privacy (as demonstrated by the fact that the prediction of individual race remains accurate even with the DAS data). We believe that more studies are needed to determine whether to inject noise and if so how exactly noise should be added. We hope that our study, along with many others, is the first step in answering this important question, by showing the potential consequences of the current DAS on certain redistricting outcomes.\r\nDoes the DAS noise “cancel out” at larger geographic scales?\r\nTheoretically yes, but with a caveat. The DAS is designed to have less noise at larger geographic scales, especially for levels of geography in the Census hierarchy, known as “on-spine” geographies (blocks, block groups, tracts, and counties). But geographies like Census places and voting precincts (VTDs) are “off-spine”. The design of the DAS may induce noise that does not cancel out in off-spine geographies.\r\nOur analysis finds that not only is there more noise for VTDs, but also that there remains a particular form of previously undiscussed bias — perhaps an unintentional side-effect of the DAS post-processing procedure needing to satisfy accuracy constraints in on-spine geographies. We find that the DAS data systematically undercounts racially and politically diverse VTDs in comparison to more homogeneous VTDs. How these discrepancies add up into legislative districts clearly depends on the spatial adjacency of diverse and homogenous VTDs. But in some cases the bias does not cancel out. In Pennsylvania, the average Congressional district changes by only 400 or so people. But the majority-Black 3rd Congressional District gains around 2,000 people under the DAS-protected data, while the more diverse 2nd Congressional District, a Black-Hispanic coalition district, loses around 2,000 people.\r\nWill the noisy data make it harder to create partisan gerrymanders?\r\nIn general, no. Partisan gerrymanders can be made with election data and voter files, both of which are not part of the Census and so will not contain any DAS-based error. Other residential and political data sources (both public and private) exist as well, which could be used to draw skewed districts. However, for analysts who must use noisy Census data to identify and analyze a potential gerrymander, the noise and the partisan biases discussed above may make it more difficult to do so.\r\nWhy is using a simulation-based method useful to assess DAS? What are the downsides?\r\nWithout the use of simulation, we are restricted to verifying changes in enacted redistricting plans. Analyzing enacted plans under a particular DAS dataset may not allow us to understand how DAS affects other similar plans. By using simulation methods, we are able to draw new maps with the DAS data under realistic constraints while taking into account the geography and spatial distributions of populations.  A downside of simulation is that the results will depend on the types of redistricting maps the algorithms are designed to generate.  More studies are needed to better understand how DAS affects different types of redistricting maps.\r\nWhy do you use strict thresholds to define equal district population parity, thereby labelling more plans invalid?\r\nThe use of strict thresholds is informed by a long series of Supreme Court decisions which establish and define the “one person, one vote” principle.  Current practice for redistricting congressional districts is to minimize the population difference across as much as possible.  As summarized by the National Conference of State Legislatures, in many states, this means getting district populations to be within a single person of one another, based on the Census counts.  If only noisy data is available, drawing districts to minimize the population difference becomes at best ambiguous.  Our analysis demonstrates the current statutory and judicial standards may not be applicable to the DAS-protected data.  On this point, our findings about the magnitude of population changes agree with many other analyses of the DAS and the April 28 Demonstration Data.  If the DAS data will be used for redistricting, the key question will be if and how to change the interpretation of “one person, one vote” principle and how such a change will affect redistricting in practice.\r\nWhy do you use a strict threshold of 50% to define the majority-minority districts (MMDs)?\r\nWe use a 50% threshold for majority minority districts to remain in line with the jurisprudence following Thornburg v. Gingles (1986). Specifically, Bartlett v. Strickland (2009) held that a minority must “constitute a numerical majority of the voting-age population in an area before §2 requires the creation of a legislative district to prevent dilution of that group’s votes.” When simulating districts, the number of districts which satisfy this specific numerical constraint is thus important. There are other ways to think about minority voting in elections, such as “opportunity districts”, “coalitional districts”, “crossover districts”, and “influence districts.” These have less concrete definitions and rely on electoral data, rather than just Census data.  Certainly, strict majorities are not the only relevant measure of minority voting power, and its coarseness makes it sensitive to change introduced by the DAS.  We find that the practice of using strict thresholds for majority minority districts may lead to biased results especially for small districts such as state legislative districts and school boards.\r\nWhy does your analysis not adjust for the differential privacy (DP) mechanism, to properly measure uncertainty?\r\nOur analysis examines the consequences of a map drawer taking DAS-protected data as-is. Ideally, analysts can also adjust for the DP mechanism into that data.  However, the Bureau’s deterministic and asymmetric post-processing procedure cannot be easily incorporated into standard redistricting analyses, preventing analysts from quantifying the added uncertainty exactly.  We recommend that the Bureau release the DP data without post-processing, allowing analysts to adjust redistricting plans with this added uncertainty. \r\nDo your findings about the prediction of individual race contradict the property of differential privacy?\r\nTechnically, no. Differential privacy guarantees that the inference based on a database does not depend on whether or not a particular individual is included in the data.  However, one might argue that for the PL94-171 data, the only sensitive information to be protected is race.  Our prediction methodology combines the census block level racial composition with the publicly available addresses and names of registered voters.  We found that our overall prediction performance does not degrade even if we use the noise-added census block data. And, yet, in our reanalysis of a recent court case where this prediction methodology was prominently used, the prediction appears to be substantively different.  We are in the process of studying when and how these differences arise.  In general, when deciding what privacy to protect at the cost of inaccurate measurements, it is important to consider the consequences of privacy disclosure.  Our finding suggests that the addition of noise to the census data does not necessarily improve the privacy protection in terms of individuals’ race.\r\nWhat are the differences between your analysis and MGGG’s analysis, both of which are based on simulation methods?\r\nThe MGGG Redistricting Lab has also released a study on using DAS data for redistricting purposes, which we believe is well done. In many ways, our results agree with those of the MGGG team. Like the MGGG study, we also find district-level population errors on the scale of hundreds or thousands of people depending on the size of the district (including Section 5 in our analysis and Figure 4 in the MGGG analysis). The core differences in these results come from interpretation. We find similarly sized errors and consider them to be major differences given that districts in many scenarios are drawn to be as exact as possible, down to individual people in many states. For example, Karcher v. Daggett (1983) found that even minute differences in population parity across congressional districts must be justified, even when smaller than the expected error in the decennial census. The MGGG team interprets their results in light of existing noise in current Census data, and say that “the practice of one-person population deviation across districts was never reasonably justified by the accuracy of Census data nor required by law.”  This implies that if DAS data are to be adopted, courts must decide how to change the interpretation of “one person, one vote” principle.\r\nOur analysis differs from the MGGG paper in several ways as well, and more studies are needed in order to better understand the impact of DAS on redistricting analysis and evaluation. First, our analysis relies on different data. We use the April 28th Demonstration Data, which the Census says will “closely approximate” the final data product, and span several states. The MGGG team uses the publicly available implementation of the 2018 TopDown algorithm with a reconstruction experiment to study Texas, mostly Dallas County, so our studies do not overlap in geographic areas.\r\nSecond, our analysis is focused on voting precincts (VTDs), which are the building blocks used in constructing redistricting plans in the vast majority of states.  Election results are also reported at this level or the state equivalent. In contrast, the MGGG analysis built districts out of Census blocks, block groups, and tracts.  These geographies are called “on-spine” by the Census bureau, since they nest within each other. Crucially, the DAS is designed to minimize error for these on-spine geographies, but not for off-spine geographies like VTDs. This may explain why our analysis finds more noise in the VTD population and racial counts than the MGGG’s analysis.\r\nWhy do you rely on Census data as the ‘ground-truth’? Doesn’t the Census itself already have enumeration error?\r\nCensus data, as acknowledged by the Bureau, has errors as well, including undercounts of some minority groups. Despite these inaccuracies, we rely on Census data for our simulations because governments and courts generally consider Census data as “ground-truth” for the purposes of drawing districts (e.g., Karcher v. Daggett 1983). The purpose of our analysis is to investigate how relying on DAS data, rather than on Census data as has generally been done in the past, may lead to different results in some cases. In an ideal world, districts drawn using DAS data would be substantively identical to those drawn with Census data. However, we find cases where districts differ by hundreds or thousands of people depending on whether one relies on the Census or DAS data. Additionally, we believe that more research is necessary to determine whether or not existing enumeration errors will cancel out the error induced by DAS, particularly for “off-spine” but substantively important geographies like VTDs.\r\nAs noted by other researchers, enumeration error is also substantively different from the random error injected as part of the DAS.  At small scales like Census blocks, DAS-injected noise is likely on a larger scale than enumeration error—some Census places have seen their population doubled or halved under the DAS, while such a result is unlikely with enumeration methods. As others have pointed out, this has the effect of adding a large random element on top of the more systematic enumeration errors, which tend to overcount or undercount larger areas or entire minority groups.  DAS does not remove or address these systematic errors; it only adds more error on top of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nThe U.S. Census Bureau plans to protect the privacy of 2020 Census respondents through its Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS), which attempts to achieve differential privacy guarantees by adding noise to the Census data. The Bureau has asked for feedback on the adequacy of DAS-protected data for real-world purposes. The ALARM project has conducted an extensive analysis into how the DAS-protected data affects redistricting and voting rights analyses, and has submitted these findings to the Census Bureau.\r\nRead the report: The Impact of the U.S. Census Disclosure Avoidance System on Redistricting and Voting Rights Analysis\r\nAlso see: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions Added on June 2, 2021.\r\nA figure from the report, indicating partisan biases in the DAS-protected data.By applying redistricting simulation and analysis methods to DAS-protected 2010 Census data, we find that the protected data are not of sufficient quality for redistricting purposes. Compared to the original Census 2010 data, we find that the DAS-protected data:\r\nPrevent map drawers from creating districts that satisfy the One Person, One Vote principle, according to current statutory and judicial standards. Actual deviations from equal population will generally be several times larger than as reported under the DAS data. The magnitude of this problem increases for smaller districts such as state legislative districts and school boards.\r\nTransfer population from low-turnout, mixed-party areas to high-turnout, single-party areas. This differential bias leads to different district boundaries, which in turn implies significant and unpredictable differences in election results. The discrepancy also degrades the ability of analysts to reliably identify partisan gerrymanders.\r\nTransfer population from racially mixed areas to racially segregated areas. This bias effectively means racially heterogeneous areas are under-counted. The degree of racial segregation can therefore be over-estimated, which can lead to a change in the number of majority-minority districts. It also creates significant precinct-level variability, which adds substantial unpredictability to whether or not a minority voter is included in a majority-minority district.\r\nAlter individual-level race predictions constructed from voter names and addresses. This leads to fewer estimated minority voters and majority-minority districts in a re-analysis of a recent Voting Rights Act case, NAACP v. East Ramapo School District. At a statewide level, however, the DAS data does not curb the ability of algorithms to identify the race of voters from names and addresses. Therefore, this casts doubt on the universal privacy protection guarantee of DAS data.\r\nOur primary recommendation is to release Census P.L. 94-171 data without using the Disclosure Avoidance System, and instead rely on a swapping method similar to that applied to the 2010 Census data in order to protect respondent privacy.\r\nIf the Census Bureau decides to apply the current DAS to Census PL. 94-171 Data, we recommend increasing the privacy loss budget and allocating the increase to improving redistricting outcomes. In particular, preserving the accuracy of populations at the voting tabulation district level would be critical. The Bureau must avoid injecting noise that systematically undercounts certain racial and partisan groups in the privacy-protected data. Additional recommendations are given in the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We plot the two-party Democratic vote share in each district, with districts sorted by this quantity.

A clear partisan gerrymander.\r\nStudying districts 1, 2, and 4\r\nIf we want to study a specific set of districts, we can quickly filter() to the relevant map area and re-run the analysis.
