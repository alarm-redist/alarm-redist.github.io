The Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology (ALARM) Project is a research group directed by Co-PIs [Kosuke Imai](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/), [Christopher T. Kenny](https://christophertkenny.com/), [Cory McCartan](https://corymccartan.com/), and [Tyler Simko](https://tylersimko.com/).

ALARM conducts research on political geography and spatial inequality. We actively work in areas like legislative redistricting, segregation, Census data, and school rezoning. We also develop open-source software to enable this research, like the R package [redist](https://alarm-redist.org/redist/).

ALARM Project researchers develop [**redist**](https://alarm-redist.org/redist/), 
an open-source R package for redistricting simulation and analysis which
implements state-of-the-art MCMC and SMC redistricting sampling algorithms.  The
package allows for the implementation of various constraints in the
redistricting process such as geographic compactness and population parity
requirements, and includes tools to compute various summary statistics and 
create useful plots.
