The Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology (ALARM) Project is a research
team at Harvard University led by [Kosuke Imai](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/).
It conducts research into redistricting sampling algorithms, best practices and
workflows for redistricting analysis, and tools to visualize, explore, and
understand redistricting plans.

<h2><code>redist</code>: Simulation Methods for Legislative Redistricting</h2>
</a>
<p>
Enables researchers to sample redistricting plans from a pre-specified target
distribution using state-of-the-art algorithms. Implements a wide variety
constraints in the redistricting process, such as geographic compactness and
population parity requirements. Tools for analysis such as computation of
various summary statistics and plotting functionality are also included.
