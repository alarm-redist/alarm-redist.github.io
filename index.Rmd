<p>
Enables researchers to sample redistricting plans from a pre-specified target
distribution using state-of-the-art algorithms. Implements a wide variety
constraints in the redistricting process, such as geographic compactness and
population parity requirements. Tools for analysis such as computation of
various summary statistics and plotting functionality are also included.
