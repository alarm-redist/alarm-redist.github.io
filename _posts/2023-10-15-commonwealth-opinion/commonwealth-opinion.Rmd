In a [new opinion piece in CommonWealth Magazine this weekend](https://commonwealthmagazine.org/opinion/using-big-data-to-make-elections-fairer/), we discuss the work of [ALARM](https://alarm-redist.org/) and the [Election Law Clinic](https://www.hlselectionlaw.org/). Our piece talks about the quantitative redistricting analysis projects, developed by the two groups, including the [50-State Redistricting Simulations](https://alarm-redist.org/fifty-states/), [PlanScore](https://planscore.org/), and [RPV Near Me](https://www.rpvnearme.org/).
