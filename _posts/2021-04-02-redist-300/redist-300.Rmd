# Workflow Example: North Carolina

To demonstrate the new `redist` workflow, we'll run through a basic analysis
of the 2017 congressional districts of the state of North Carolina, which
were [struck down as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/north-carolina-judges-toss-maps-slam-gerrymandering-stinging-ruling-n1049411) 
in 2019.

## New workflow
```{r message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(redist)

download.file("https://github.com/alarm-redist/redist-data/raw/main/data/nc.rds",
              data_path <- tempfile())
nc_shp <- readRDS(data_path) %>%
    select(vtd:vap, el14g_uss_r:geometry)
```

Under the new workflow, a redistricting analysis begins with a `redist_map`
object, which defines the basic parameters of the redistricting problem. 
The `redist_map()` constructor builds the precinct adjacency graph which is
required for redistricting simulation, and stores relevant metadata, such as
the desired population parity tolerance and a reference to the existing 
districts. It also comes with helpful plotting functions.

```{r message=F}
nc = redist_map(nc_shp, existing_plan=cd_17, pop_tol=0.01)
print(nc)
plot(nc, el14g_uss_d/(el14g_uss_d+el14g_uss_r)) +
    scale_fill_gradient2(midpoint=0.5)
```

Once we've created a `redist_map` object, we can simulate redistricting plans.

```{r cache=T}
plans = redist_smc(nc, 1000, counties=county, silent=TRUE) # 1000 plans
print(plans)
```

The `plans` variable is a `redist_plans` object---a special container designed
to make handling sets of redistricting plans painless. As the output above
shows, `plans` contains the 1,000 samppled plans, plus the 2017 congressional
districts.  We can plot a few of these plans.

```{r nc-plans, layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=8}
redist.plot.plans(plans, draws=c("cd_17", "1", "2", "3"), geom=nc)
```

A `redist_plans` object makes it easy to compute plan and district summary
statistics.

```{r}
plans = plans %>%
    mutate(comp = distr_compactness(nc),
           dem_share = group_frac(nc, el14g_uss_d, el14g_uss_d + el14g_uss_r))
print(plans)
```

From there, we can quickly generate informative plots. First we check the
compactness of the generated plans, and see that they are significantly more 
compact than the adopted 2017 plan.

```{r nc-comp}
hist(plans, comp) +
    labs(x="Compactness score (higher is more compact)")
```

Next, we look at the partisan implications of the 2017 plan. We plot the
two-party Democratic vote share in each district, with districts sorted by
this quantity. Each dot on the plot below is a district from one simulated plan,
and the red lines show the values for the 2017 plan.

```{r nc-dem, layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=8}
redist.plot.distr_qtys(plans, dem_share, size=0.1)
```

We see immediately that the 2017 plan packs Democratic voters into the three
most Democratic districts, and cracks them in the remaining 10 districts,
leading to a durable 10--3 Republican-Democratic seat split (in an election
which Democrats captured 
`r scales::percent(sum(nc$el14g_uss_d)/sum(nc$el14g_uss_d+nc$el14g_uss_r))`
of the statewide two-party vote). A clear partisan gerrymander.

### Studying districts 1, 2, and 4
If we want to study a specific set of districts, we can quickly `filter()` to
the relevant map area and re-run the analysis. The `redist_map()` object will
handle all appropriate adjustments to the adjacency graph, number of districts,
and population tolerance (as is visible below).

```{r}
nc_sub = filter(nc, cd_17 %in% c(1, 2, 4))
print(nc_sub)
plot(nc_sub)
```

On this subset, too, the adopted 2017 plan is a significant outlier.

```{r nc-sub}
plans_sub = redist_smc(nc_sub, 1000, counties=county, silent=T) %>%
    mutate(dem_share = group_frac(nc_sub, el14g_uss_d, el14g_uss_d + el14g_uss_r))
redist.plot.distr_qtys(plans_sub, dem_share, size=0.3)
```

## Old workflow

In comparison, the old workflow required significantly more steps and manual
processing. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(redist)

download.file("https://github.com/alarm-redist/redist-data/raw/main/data/nc.rds",
              data_path <- tempfile())
nc_shp <- readRDS(data_path) %>%
    select(vtd:vap, el14g_uss_r:geometry)
```

Once we've downloaded the data, we can start by building the adjacency graph.

```{r}
adj <- redist.adjacency(nc_shp)
```

Time to first simulation was never really the issue, however each simulation
required many inputs. `redist_map` objects keep track of the `adj`, `total_pop`,
`ndists`, and `pop_tol` arguments, but in the older version, you had to specify
each of these for every simulation. One of the quirky aspects of the older
version was that `counties` needed to be a vector with values `1:n_counties`,
meaning that you had to manually transform it to use it and that only worked if
the counties were contiguous.

```{r include=F}
sims = list(plans = get_plans_matrix(plans))
```
```{r eval=F}
sims <- redist.smc(adj = adj, total_pop = nc_shp$pop, ndists = 13, 
                   pop_tol = 0.01, 
                   counties = match(nc_shp$county, unique(nc_shp$county)), 
                   nsims = 1000, silent = TRUE)
```

Once you finished simulating, setting up plots was always a hassle, as you
needed to plot both the distribution of simulations and then compute the same
metric separately for the reference plan, in this case that's the 2017
congressional districts.

```{r}
metrics <- redist.metrics(plans = sims$plans, measure = 'DVS',
                          rvote = nc_shp$el14g_uss_r, nc_shp$el14g_uss_d)

sorted <- metrics %>% 
  group_by(draw) %>% 
  arrange(DVS,.by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(district = 1:13) %>% 
  ungroup()

reference_metrics <- redist.metrics(plans = nc_shp$cd_17, 
                                    measure = 'DVS', 
                                    rvote = nc_shp$el14g_uss_r, 
                                    dvote = nc_shp$el14g_uss_d)

sorted_reference <- reference_metrics %>% 
    arrange(DVS) %>% 
    mutate(district = 1:13)
```

And then to plot the standard stacked boxplots, you would need to add the
reference plan manually to the rest.

```{r}
sorted %>% ggplot(aes(x = district, y = DVS, group = district)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = 'District, sorted by DVS') + 
  geom_segment(data = sorted_reference, size = 1,
               aes(x = district - 0.35, xend = district + 0.35, 
                   yend = DVS, color = 'red')) + 
  scale_color_manual(name = '', values = c('red' = 'red'),
  labels = c('ref'), guide = 'legend')
```


### Studying districts 1, 2, and 4
The steps between loading in data to your first simulation wasn't terrible in
the old version when you were working with the full map. However, when trying to
work with subsets, it became messy.

First you needed to subset the shape and then rebuild a new adjacency graph that
only had the remaining precincts.

```{r}
sub <- nc_shp %>% filter(cd_17 %in% c(1, 2, 4))
sub_adj <- redist.adjacency(sub)
```

Then, if your target on the full map was 1\%, you had to compute the equivalent
on the subset map, as a 1\% population deviation on a subset is often larger
once recombined with the full map.

```{r}
pop_tol <- 0.01
subparpop <- sum(sub$pop)/3
parpop <- sum(nc_shp$pop)/13

sub_pop_tol <-  min(abs(subparpop - parpop * (1 - pop_tol)),
                abs(subparpop - parpop * (1 + pop_tol))) / subparpop
sub_pop_tol
```


Now we can simulate again, but on the smaller map.

```{r include=F}
sims_sub = list(plans = get_plans_matrix(plans_sub))
```
```{r eval=F}
sims_sub <- redist.smc(adj = sub_adj, total_pop = sub$pop,
                      nsims = 1000,  ndists = 3, 
                      counties = match(sub$county, unique(sub$county)),
                      pop_tol = sub_pop_tol, silent = TRUE)
```


As before, we have to compute metrics for both the reference plan and the simulated plans.

```{r}
sub_metrics <- redist.metrics(plans = sims_sub$plans, measure = 'DVS', 
                              rvote = sub$el14g_uss_r, sub$el14g_uss_d)

sub_sorted <- sub_metrics %>% 
  group_by(draw) %>% 
  arrange(DVS,.by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(district = 1:3) %>% 
  ungroup()

sub_reference_metrics <- redist.metrics(plans = match(sub$cd_17, 
                                                      unique(sub$cd_17)), 
                                        measure = 'DVS', 
                                        rvote = sub$el14g_uss_r, 
                                        dvote = sub$el14g_uss_d)

sub_sorted_reference <- sub_reference_metrics %>%
    arrange(DVS) %>% 
    mutate(district = 1:3)
```

And finally, we can plot the metrics and manually add the reference points.

```{r}
sub_sorted %>% ggplot(aes(x = district, y = DVS, group = district)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = 'District, sorted by DVS') + 
  geom_segment(data = sub_sorted_reference, size = 1,
               aes(x = district - 0.35, xend = district + 0.35, 
                   yend = DVS, color = 'red')) + 
  scale_color_manual(name = '', values = c('red' = 'red'),
  labels = c('ref'), guide = 'legend')
```
