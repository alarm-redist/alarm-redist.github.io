At the end of May, the ALARM Project [released a report](/posts/2021-05-28-census-das/)
examining "The Impact U.S. Census Disclosure Avoidance System on Redistricting
and Voting Rights Analysis."  The Census Bureau has since updated the system parameters
and released 2020 Census Data protected under this Disclosure Avoidance System.

Our original report has been revised to include an analysis of the new system
parameters, and appears today in the journal *Science Advances*.
