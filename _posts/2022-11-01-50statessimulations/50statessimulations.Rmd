We're excited to share that our article, *Simulated redistricting plans for the analysis and evaluation of redistricting in the United States*, is now available through [Nature Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01808-2). This is a great step in making alternative redistricting plans more available for the public and researchers.

Check out the [`alarmdata` R package](https://alarm-redist.org/alarmdata/) for some helpers for working with this data!

Want more information? Take a look at [the blog post that accompanied the release of the original working paper](https://alarm-redist.org/posts/2022-06-23-fifty-states-data-descriptor/) or [an early use of this data](https://alarm-redist.org/posts/2022-08-14-gerrymandering-mostly-cancels-nationally/).
