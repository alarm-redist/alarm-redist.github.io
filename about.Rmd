# The Project

The ALARM Project is a research team at Harvard University led by 
[Kosuke Imai](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/).  It conducts research into
redistricting sampling algorithms, best practices and workflows for
redistricting analysis, and tools to visualize, explore, and understand
redistricting plans.
ALARM Project researchers develop [**redist**](https://alarm-redist.github.io/redist/), 
an open-source R package for redistricting simulation and analysis which
implements state-of-the-art MCMC and SMC redistricting sampling algorithms.  The
package allows for the implementation of various constraints in the
redistricting process such as geographic compactness and population parity
requirements, and includes tools to compute various summary statistics and 
create useful plots.
